When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Working with others on the same project, using a remote repository allows teams to 
collaborate remotely.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so as to make sure that every commit represents a significant change in the repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones and, branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
forks are used when a team wishes to make remote clones of a repository.
clones are used to make a local copy of a repository.
branches are basically copies of the master branch but are made to experiment;
making changes to the repository that could work out or not.
